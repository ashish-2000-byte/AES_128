# AES-128 Hardware Accelerator (SystemVerilog RTL)

A fully synthesizable **AES-128 encryption engine** designed in **SystemVerilog** and verified using **Vivado XSim**.

This project implements the complete AES datapath at RTL level and is intended for **FPGA/SoC hardware acceleration**, with future integration into a custom **RISC-V processor** as a memory-mapped crypto accelerator.

##  Project Goal

The objective of this project is to:

- Design AES-128 from scratch at RTL
- Understand hardware implementation of cryptographic algorithms
- Build a reusable FPGA accelerator IP
- Integrate later into a RISC-V SoC

This demonstrates **digital design, RTL coding, FSM design, and hardware verification skills**.
